# BOETHUS
Boethus is a Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) or Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) and Boethus means "help" or "assist" in greek.<br>
I created Boethus to help user to do anything by voice commanding. It helps user to search a keyword and read the summury for you or you can search a keyword in youtube and open it in your web browser. You want to turn off you computer also possible as well.
<br>

## Installation
My project requires some of extension library of python. You just need to
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
<br>
If you have an error you don't have "PyAudio" then you need to install that as well
<br>
```
pip install PyAudio
```

## Usage
By executing "python3 main.py" in the terminal for mac, ubuntu or cmd for windows:

After Boethus is activated you can say "hello" or "hi" then it will respond to you and ready to take voice command from you.

Here is the list of keywords 
- who are you?
- what time is it?
- change settings (you can change gender of yours for now)
- google
- youtube
- where is or location
- what is or wikipedia
- turn off pc (computer), shut down pc (computer)
- terminate or stop
